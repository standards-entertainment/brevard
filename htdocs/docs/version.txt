v 02.5.20
CHANGELOG

- Records.PHP
	- Implemented a basic search engine for proof of concept.

- Delslip / PU Slip / New Cust Info / Edit Counterparts

	- Developed a JQUERY / AJAX solution to the page refreshing upon submit problem. Form now has further validation. Implemented to all.

- Delslip / PU Slip / New Cust Info / Invoice / Edit Counterparts

	- Developed a JQUERY / AJAX solution to the APOSTROPHE CATASTROPHE, now you will have to actually COPY AND PASTE an apostrophe into the field because it will not let you type it normally. I will probably change the copy / paste privileges of an apostrophe as well!

v 02.7.50
General Changes:
- Driver Tickets -

**As Requested By Client**
	- Developed a JQUERY / Javascript pop-up solution that requests verification upon exit of the site, specifically designed to be precise in when to request. For example, if a user is submitting a form, or clicking on an INTERNAL site link, it will not ask, for the obvious hassling reasons. However if the user attempts to close the window, hit the back or forward buttons on the browser, refresh, click an EXTERNAL link or go to an EXTERNAL page, it will stop and make sure that the user does in fact intend on doing what they did.

Warehouse Inventory EXTENSION:

- Added an inventory1.php - This is used to access the actual inventory itself. This is the backbone of the extension. This displays all pertinent information about the products that are being inventoried.

- Implemented fully functional search engine, which allows one to search by 'ID' (Unique ID, for each entry.) 'PID' (Product ID, not unique, for the user's preference.) 'Name' (Name of the product being inventoried.) 'Description' (Description of product being inventoried.) 'Comments' (Comments on the item, whether it's damaged, used, etc. may also be inventoried.) Stock In, and Stock Out integers.

- Implemented a DELETE function, when an item is sold, destroyed, disposed of, etc, it can be removed from the inventory on user side.

- Implemented an EDIT function, items need to be edited from time to time, so this is where this comes in. If a product description needs to be altered, comments changed or added, etc. This makes it possible and easy to do for the user.

- Implemented an ADD NEW function, so that the user may add new products at their discretion. It is a small, blank form that they may enter the pertinent information to be stored in the database.

- Added Stock In / Stock Out fields with automatic adjusting quantity values. Now you just put in the stock in, and stock out, and the sum/difference (preferred is set upon installation.) between the two will be made into the total quantity.

- Integrated our previously existing Audit Trail for obvious security reasons. Anytime anything is edited it will be logged and archived for our records and will be used to weed out any user-side nuisances.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Cruise Slips
	- Created a new module from scratch for the cruise slips.
	- Doesn't save credit card / payment information.
	- Requires all form verification and user authentication as every other module. (Including apostrophe control, driver field authentication, page close yes/no authentication, and audit trail.)
	- Created a new category within records, where completed and saved slips can be accessed and / or edited.
	- Created a concurrent editing system to run beside the CruiseSlips, will auto-populate with the pertinent information and will update the database queries as requested.
	-

- Driver Slips
	- Now show special instructions within the summary.

- Inventory search has been temporarily disengaged.
